# Sql Create Tables Lab

Building off of what we've learned about creating tables and column types, let's play around with writing SQL CREATE statements.

## Learning Objectives

1. Learn to write SQL CREATE statements
2. Learn about the different column types supported in SQL and SQLite3

## About This Lab

Let's take a look at this lab's structure, which will seem slightly different than what you've been working with before.

```bash
├── Gemfile
├── README.md
├── bin
│   ├── environment.rb # requires bundler and files
│   ├── run.rb # instantiates the SQLRunner class in the below file
│   └── sql_runner.rb # holds a class that handles executing your .sql files
├── lib
│   ├── create.sql # where you create your schema
└── spec # all the specs
    ├── create_spec.rb # this tests your create_table.sql file
    └── spec_helper.rb
```

The way SQL labs work is that you'll write your SQL statements in `.sql` files in the `lib/` directory, and the `run.rb` file in `bin/` will execute them using the `sql_runner.rb` class. When you run the tests, the SQLRunner class is called and a new database is created in memory for the tests.

## Todo

Create a table called cats with the following columns and types:

|column | type  |
|-------|-------|
|id     |primary key|
|name   |text   |
|age    |integer|
|gender |char(1)(The choices would be "M" or "F")|
|breed  |text   |
|temperament|text|
|declawed |boolean|
